Stellar Sprites

Drag prefabs from "resources" folder into scene or Instantiate them at runtime.  That's really it.  Stellar Sprites doesn't handle any gameplay mechanics, only sprite generation and the few demo scripts provided.

Additonal Notes:
	
	Sorting Layers - For the included demo scenes to work properly, you will want to setup your sorting layers in this order:
		
		Default
		Background
		Starfield
		Blackhole
		Sun
		Cloud
		Planet
		Moon
		Station
		Asteroid
		Ship
		UI

I am very aware that the included sprite generating code is not optimized.
